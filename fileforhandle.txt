The digital revolution has already changed how people live, work, and communicate. And itâ€™s only just getting started. But the same technologies that have the potential to help billions of people live happier, healthier, and more productive lives are also creating new challenges for citizens and governments around the world. From election meddling to data breaches and cyberattacks, recent events have shown that technology is changing how we think about privacy, national security, and maybe even democracy itself. In this project, we examine challenges in five key areas that will shape the future of the digital age: justice system, impact on democracy, global security and international conflict, the impact of automations and AI on the jobs marketplace, identity, and privacy.
